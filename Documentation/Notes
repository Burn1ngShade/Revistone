--- Change Log Info ---

Update Magnitudes:
[Minor] -> small update, typically visual or non intrusive bugs
[Notable] -> medium update, new function, or constructors, or decent bug fixes
[Major] -> big update, used for rehauls, or exspansions to mechanics
[QuickFix] -> update that was console breaking, required immediate fix (couldnt wait)

// note magnitude does not mean the same for parts of an update, e.g a major bug may not be the same as to a major feature or update in size.

// note bug sections of update will be much smaller than the actual bugs fixed, while I try my best, logging every bug when writing the change log is difficult and many are most likely missed.
