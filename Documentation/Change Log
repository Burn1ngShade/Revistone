+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+

Specifics:

[Major]
ConsoleDisplay -> Resizing window added
ConsoleAnimatedLine -> Redid script, instead of using predefinded methods, uses action with consoleLine and metadata of the animatedLine, Deep Copys, []Predefinded methods added (shiftColour, shiftLetters, consoletheme)

[Notable]
UserInputProfile -> Added [A:] and [A_number], allowing to specify any type of charchter digit or puncation, new whitespace options
ColourFuctions -> Create gradient without length (one gradient long), Create ConsoleColor[] from colours and lengths, 

[Minor]
Revistone -> slight graphical changes
ConsoleAction -> GetDebugLine(), options for editing animatedLine on SendingMessage, option for string and consoleLineUpdate on SendingMessage
AppCommands -> debug[A:] sends debug message

Fixed Bugs:

[Major]
Length dependent types in formatting did not work, and would allow and length 
Resizing window breaks program until input (yay)

[Notable]
Resizing window caused debug console to shrink by one
Resizing window caused debug console index to be moved
Clear debug did not clear last consoleline

[Minor] 
borders dont have righht length colour[]
resizing borders width wont update title and border length
consoleLineIndex would be shifted when resizing window
EnclosedConsole shift will not cause dynamic line to change (intentional behaviour but not good ygm)

Summary: 
Add the ability to create images and videos! Also changes to App structure, allowing for apps to be created within script,

[Major]
Added starts of usage guide to github read me 
ConsoleImage -> Image support added to the console (limited rn but will be improved)
ConsoleVideo -> Video support for console (limited rn but will be improved)
App Registry -> Added, controls registry apps and allows app to be directly added from script

[Notable]
Moved documentation into own folder out of scripts
ConsoleAnimatedLine -> Now uses object for metaData instead of string, (no clue why i didnt do this before), also sends AnimatedLineData in action to increase dynamic nature
DebitCardManager -> Updated, Cleaned up and updated to use newer methods, still easily worse written class in project, but no longer complete s*** (mostly)
App -> Redone to have its main and only function to be the parent class for apps
Revistone -> Console look refreshed!
Manager -> Added renderLockobjcet, preventing all errors with rendering, as well as call to AppRegistry

[Minor]
ConsoleData -> Added debugStartIndex, and debugBufferStartIndex to reduce aribtrey values, removed consoleUpdated as it was always false
ConsoleAction -> MarkPrimaryConsoleForUpdate()
ConsoleDisplay -> Changes to renderOrder and intruduction of renderLockObject
UserInput -> Modifided to prevent errors, now matches consoleColourScheme, Added optionMenu wich excutes actions
StringFunctions -> Reanmes and change to exstentions

Fixed Bugs:

[Major]
App ui breaks if origanlly loaded with min height / width 2 small
dynamic lines break on screen change (LAST MAJOR VISUAL UPDATE BYE BYE)

[Notable]
fixed bug with renderLockObject, causing animatedLines to update a tick late
Exiting and reloading debit card manager resaves inital text in debitcard.text

[Minor]
Resizing windows causes ConsoleLineIndex to occasinaly move to far forward
UserInputProfile outputed input.length rather than modInput.length

--- Console Fix Patch --- [QuickFix] 0.2.1 (16/11/23)

Bug Fixes:

--- Performance And Rendering --- [Major] 0.4.0 (4/12/23)

Summary:
Massive performance improvements via the usage of custom rendering (like 12 * faster at peak) (replacing ConsoleLine) as well
a new profiler, allowing for easy testing! this version of the console is capable of handling 2d 
games easily (and possibly more advanced rendering) and is first version id consider possible for 1.0
on user side (though code base needs update, coming soon). And BG colour support!
As far as i know this version is the first without any rendering crashes (im 100% wrong)

Specifics:

[Major]
HoneyC [WIP] -> Over 900 lines working on new complete HoneyCLanguage, with classes objects, and capable of being a full programming language once complete, eventually want to spin off into it's own interpreter program so dependecys with revistone console at absoulute minimum, with only script talking to over parts of the console being Diagnostic, which handles displaying the output from the language. Language highlighting extension for VSCode https://github.com/Burn1ngShade/HoneyCLanguageFeatures
User Input -> Rewrote user input (again xD), added many important features, MULTILINE INPUT!!!!!!, input history saved between sessions, far more traversal and select options (all keybinds found by running command 'Hotkeys'), now cleans user input to prevent console breaking
Tetris -> Added colour tetris game to the console, as example of how to create games with background colours.
Tracker -> Tracker app improvements and rewrite, including arcs, time settings for data collection, better data collection, visual overhaul, bug fixes and much more
Settings -> Add settings app to allow users to customise and modify revistone to their preferences, allowing users to detail there name and pronouns, modify input settings, and chatGPT settings
GPTFunctions -> Added chatGPT implementation to the project (First dependency but kinda needed), REQUIRES API KEY, fully customisable with plans to expand to voice control and implement the ability to interact with the console and more
NumericalFunctions -> Simplifed functions, as well as adding a variance function
String Functions -> added the ability to get a charchters console width, this is based on conventions and will not work with all fonts or cover all cases, USE WITH CAUTION.

[Notable]
FlashCardManager -> Added new cambridge revision, driving, and mechanics equations tests
AppCommands -> 8 new commands, hotkeys -> list of revistone hotkeys, comp and file comp run HoneyC files (old comp renamed to calc), gpt to query chat gpt, snap gpt to query gpt without message memory, clear gpt to clear message memory, get setting to check the value of a setting, and set setting to set the value of a setting.
ConsoleLine -> Added IsEmpty() checking if line has length of 0, and Clean() which removes invalid, zero and double length charchters from a console line
ColourFunctions -> New trans pattern added, TRANS RIGHTS!, added Stretch function, stretches array by given factor

[Minor]
Calculator -> Renamed (prev: HoneyC) renamed orignal basic HoneyC to calculator, as it was only capable of basic maths, flags and loops
Revistone -> Added welcome back message to users with set console name
App -> Added new OnRevistoneStartup() called when revistone is first added
User Input Profile -> Options to set a numericMin and numericMax,
Manger -> Modified userinput to allow multiline input (max 3 lines), and updated close prevention warning to new keybind
TitleFunctions -> Added ability to add topspace to a title

BugFixes:

[Major]
Added blockRender to ConsoleRenderLogic, stopping rendering post error and allowing c# compiler and runtime errors to be viewed.

[Notable]
Optimised rendering to prevent lines from overflowwing
Now take absoulute value of GetAsyncKeyState in comparision
Fixed ConsoleLineUpdate static presets being incorrect

[Minor]
Fixed bug with AdvancedHighlight not correctly highlighting in certain cases
Fixed 0.5.0 documentation missing [Major, Notable, Minor] tags.
Fixed cash warning from 6.0 dotnet files

--- Performance And Widgets --- [Major] 0.6.1 (14/03/25)

Summary:
Performance issues resolved, seeing upwards of 40 to 50x improvements to performance!!!! New dynamic widget system which allows for another major way to create custom content for the console, and new fonts and fontshowcase app.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+

Specifics:

[Major]
ConsoleRendererLogic -> A massive performance improvement (genuinely 40x/50x in some cases, render test average tick time going from > 35 to 0), spent hours messing around with multithreading before finding the root of the issue to be calls to System.Console.WindowWidth (kill me)
TitleFunctions -> 12 new fonts! (total 30), AsciiNewRoman, Banner3, BigMoney(NE|SE|SW), Cards, Chiseled, DrPepper, FlowerPower, Impossible, Puffy, TinkerToy. fonts now sorted aphabetically
Widgets -> new way to interact with the console, use widgets that appear at the bottom boreder regardless of app, 4 built in widgets time, fps, author, timer, with easy ability to create new custom widgets
FontShowcaseApp -> new app for displaying previewing all revistone fonts, see how your custom text looks in every font

[Notable]
AppCommands -> 3 new commands, settings -> shortcut for load settings, timer and cancel timer for using the new timer widget
GPTFunctions -> new tools for creating and deleting timers, first step towards more interactive GPT
HoneyC -> more work on HoneyC application
Settings -> 4 new settings, option to create log file for HoneyC programs, and options to enable or disable the three default widgets (time, fps, author)

[Minor]
ColourFunctions -> new AllColours preset, features all ConsoleColours in enum index order
Profiler -> Improved profiler UI including averages over the past 20 ticks
UserInput -> F1-F24 now added to exception key list
App -> SecondaryColour (renamed from secondaryColours to be inline with primaryColour and tetiaryColour)
ConsoleAnimatedLine -> new functions ShiftBackgroundColour, and ShiftColour (shifts foreground and background), ShiftColour renamed to ShiftForegroundColour
Revistone -> new render test command for loading the rendering system
Manager -> lastTickTime renamed to _deltaTime and new public deltaTime variable, which returns the duration (seconds) of the last frame.

BugsFixes:

[Major]

[Notable]
Borders not going all the way to the edge of the screen

[Minor]
Fixed using number 99 for many enumerable.repeats on titles, instead of title.length
Current App Title Being Slightly Too Far To The Right
Renamed Revistone.Apps to Revistone.App for consistency

--- WORKING TITLE --- [Major] 0.7.0 (14/05/25)

Summary: 
Biggest update ever (again! technically beaten on lines, but lots of code modifided and removed), the console feels like a completely new tool after every update, only took 2 months this time!
