Specifics:

[Major]
ConsoleDisplay -> Resizing window added
ConsoleAnimatedLine -> Redid script, instead of using predefinded methods, uses action with consoleLine and metadata of the animatedLine, Deep Copys, []Predefinded methods added (shiftColour, shiftLetters, consoletheme)

[Notable]
UserInputProfile -> Added [A:] and [A_number], allowing to specify any type of charchter digit or puncation, new whitespace options
ColourFuctions -> Create gradient without length (one gradient long), Create ConsoleColor[] from colours and lengths, 

[Minor]
Revistone -> slight graphical changes
ConsoleAction -> GetDebugLine(), options for editing animatedLine on SendingMessage, option for string and consoleLineUpdate on SendingMessage
AppCommands -> debug[A:] sends debug message

Fixed Bugs:

[Major]
Length dependent types in formatting did not work, and would allow and length 
Resizing window breaks program until input (yay)

[Notable]
Resizing window caused debug console to shrink by one
Resizing window caused debug console index to be moved
Clear debug did not clear last consoleline

[Minor] 
borders dont have righht length colour[]
resizing borders width wont update title and border length
consoleLineIndex would be shifted when resizing window
EnclosedConsole shift will not cause dynamic line to change (intentional behaviour but not good ygm)
